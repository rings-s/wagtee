# Testing Configuration - Payment Gateway Removed

## Overview
Payment gateway integration has been removed from the Wagtee application to enable testing without payment processing. All payment functionality has been replaced with testing configurations.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **Models (`accounts/models.py`)**
   - Commented out `lemon_squeezy_subscription_id` field in Subscription model
   - Subscription logic remains functional for testing

2. **Serializers (`accounts/serializers.py`)**
   - Removed payment gateway field from SubscriptionSerializer
   - Subscription creation still works for testing

3. **Settings (`back/settings.py`)**
   - Payment configuration section commented out
   - App runs without payment dependencies

4. **Database Migration**
   - Created `0002_remove_payment_gateway_fields.py` to remove payment fields
   - Run `python manage.py migrate` after setting up environment

### Frontend Changes

1. **Subscription Page (`routes/subscription/+page.svelte`)**
   - Replaced payment gateway redirects with testing alerts
   - Users see confirmation messages instead of payment processing

2. **Subscription Store (`stores/subscription.svelte.ts`)**
   - Mock upgrade responses for testing
   - No external payment gateway calls

3. **Types (`lib/types/index.ts`)**
   - Commented out payment gateway ID field
   - Subscription interface remains functional

4. **Route Documentation (`ROUTE_STRUCTURE.md`)**
   - Updated API routes to reflect testing configuration
   - Removed payment webhook references

## Testing Mode Features

### Subscription Management
- All subscription tiers (Basic, Standard, Premium) are available
- Subscription limits are enforced properly
- Testing alerts show upgrade confirmations
- Admin can manually activate subscriptions

### How to Test Subscriptions

1. **Create Test Users**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

2. **Manual Subscription Assignment**
   ```python
   from accounts.models import User, Subscription
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta
   
   user = User.objects.get(phone_number='+966xxxxxxxxx')
   subscription = Subscription.objects.create(
       user=user,
       tier='premium',
       price=60.00,
       is_active=True,
       end_date=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=30)
   )
   ```

3. **Test Subscription Features**
   - Login with test user
   - Navigate to `/subscription` page
   - Click upgrade buttons (shows testing alerts)
   - Check feature access based on subscription tier

## Post-Deployment Configuration

### When Ready for Production

1. **Choose Payment Gateway**
   - Lemon Squeezy (original choice)
   - Stripe
   - Local Saudi payment providers (mada, STC Pay, etc.)

2. **Re-enable Payment Integration**
   - Uncomment payment fields in models
   - Create migration to add payment fields back
   - Add payment gateway dependencies to requirements.txt
   - Configure payment webhooks
   - Update frontend to handle real payment flows

3. **Environment Variables to Add**
   ```bash
   # For Lemon Squeezy (example)
   LEMON_SQUEEZY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   LEMON_SQUEEZY_STORE_ID=your_store_id
   LEMON_SQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
   ```

4. **Update Frontend Payment Handlers**
   - Replace alert messages with actual payment redirects
   - Add payment success/failure pages
   - Configure proper checkout flows

## Current Functionality

- Business profile management
- Service creation and management
- Booking system (anonymous and authenticated)
- Subscription tier limits enforcement
- Role-based access control
- WhatsApp notifications (if configured)
- QR code generation
- Analytics and reporting

### ðŸ”§ Testing Mode Features
- Subscription management (manual assignment)

## Security Notes

- No payment data is stored or processed in testing mode
- All payment-related code is safely commented out
- Database schema changes are tracked in migrations
- Easy to re-enable payment features when ready

## Next Steps

1. Complete application testing in current state
2. Deploy application to production environment
3. Choose and configure payment gateway
4. Re-enable payment integration using migrations
5. Test payment flows in staging environment
6. Go live with full payment processing
